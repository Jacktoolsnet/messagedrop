Summary (non-binding)

MessageDrop is operated with due care; however, permanent availability or error-free operation cannot be guaranteed.

We assume no responsibility for user-generated content or for content and services provided by third parties; reported unlawful content is reviewed and removed after becoming aware of it.

External services and embeds (e.g., YouTube, OpenStreetMap, DeepL) are subject to the terms and privacy policies of the respective providers.

Certain data is stored locally on your device and may be lost at any time; we assume no liability for such loss.

MessageDrop does not provide access to emergency services.

Only the full Disclaimer below is legally relevant.


---

1. Scope

This disclaimer applies to the use of the website and the app “MessageDrop” (messagedrop.de) operated by
JackTools.Net UG (haftungsbeschränkt),
Im Kirchfeld 27,
38304 Wolfenbüttel, Germany
(hereinafter “we” or “provider”).


---

2. Availability

We strive to provide the service reliably.
However, technical or other reasons may result in restrictions, interruptions, or outages.
A specific level of availability is not guaranteed.


---

3. Content – own content, user-generated content, and third-party content

a) Own content

Our own content is created with due care.
Nevertheless, we do not assume any warranty for accuracy, completeness, or timeliness.


---

b) User-generated content (UGC)

Users may create and publish content.
We use automated procedures (including AI-assisted detection), but do not perform comprehensive prior review of all content.

Content can be reported. In addition, a “hide” function may render content globally invisible, meaning it is no longer visible to any users.
Reports of unlawful content are reviewed promptly and such content is removed or blocked upon becoming aware of it (“notice and takedown”).


---

c) Information and services of third parties

Certain features are based on external services, in particular:

weather and air quality data from Open-Meteo

translations via DeepL

location and reverse geocoding via Nominatim / OpenStreetMap


Despite careful selection, deviations, outages, quota or rate limits, and API changes may occur.
We do not assume any warranty for accuracy, completeness, availability, or timeliness of such content and services.
The respective terms of use and license conditions of the providers apply.
Note: Required attributions (e.g., “© OpenStreetMap contributors”) are provided.


---

4. Embeds and external providers

(YouTube, Pinterest, TikTok, Tenor, Spotify)

External media (e.g., YouTube videos, TikTok clips, Pinterest pins, Tenor GIFs, Spotify content) are embedded by users.
The respective provider is solely responsible for such content.

When activating or displaying such content, data (e.g., IP address, usage data) may be transmitted to the respective provider; their terms of use and privacy policies apply.
Within the app, external content can be enabled or disabled on a provider-specific basis.


---

5. External links

Our service may contain links to external websites.
We have no influence over their content; the respective operator is always responsible.

At the time of linking, the content was checked for possible legal violations.
Permanent monitoring of linked content is not reasonable without concrete indications.
If we become aware of legal violations, such links will be removed promptly.


---

6. Copyright

Where content is not created by us, we respect the rights of third parties and label such content accordingly.
If you suspect a copyright or legal infringement, please notify us at jacktoolsnet@gmail.com.
If the complaint is justified, the content will be removed promptly.


---

7. Data protection notice

Information on the processing of personal data can be found in our Privacy Policy.
This disclaimer does not constitute a privacy policy.


---

8. No access to emergency services

Our website/app does not provide access to emergency services (e.g., police, fire department, emergency medical services).


---

9. Local data storage (e.g., IndexedDB) and data loss

Our app stores certain data locally on your device or in your browser (e.g., IndexedDB, local/session storage, or app cache) to enable offline or stability features.
Such local data is device- and browser-specific and is not automatically synchronized with other devices or a cloud (unless explicitly stated).

Local data may be lost or deleted at any time, including due to:

manual deletion of website/app or browser data

use of private/incognito mode

automatic cleanup by browser or operating system

storage or quota limits, profile or browser changes

uninstallation/reinstallation (e.g., PWA) or system/browser updates


To the extent permitted by law, we assume no liability for loss, damage, or unavailability of locally stored data or for any resulting damages.
Where available, please use export or backup functions and keep backups outside the device.


---

10. Backend availability, maintenance, and server-side data loss

Our backend is operated and monitored with due care.
Nevertheless, disruptions may occur, for example due to planned or unplanned maintenance, infrastructure or provider outages, network issues, security incidents (e.g., DDoS), software or database updates, or force majeure.

A specific availability or recovery time is not guaranteed.
We create backups at reasonable intervals; however, in the event of an incident, data loss (e.g., between the last backup and the time of the incident) or temporary functional limitations may occur.
Complete restoration at any given time cannot be guaranteed.

To the extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect damages, loss of profit, data loss, or consequential damages resulting from backend disruptions.
Claims based on intent or gross negligence and mandatory statutory liability remain unaffected.


---

11. Changes

We reserve the right to amend this disclaimer at any time.
The version published at the time shall apply.
