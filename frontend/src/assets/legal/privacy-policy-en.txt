PRIVACY POLICY
Status: December 14, 2025

IMPORTANT NOTICE:
This English version is provided for convenience only. Legally binding is solely the current and complete German version of this Privacy Policy. In the event of discrepancies, the German version shall prevail.

###
Summary (non-binding)
###

MessageDrop is a privacy-oriented web application for publishing user-generated content, private communication, and location-based organization of information.

The service can be used without creating a user account. Certain features require the voluntary creation of a user account.

The use of MessageDrop is permitted exclusively for persons who are at least 16 years old.

A large portion of the data is deliberately stored exclusively locally on the user’s end device (e.g., browser or app storage) in order to ensure data minimization and a high level of data protection. Full control over locally stored data lies with the user. Local data may be lost or deleted at any time.

Public content and comments are created by users and may be reported, reviewed, and moderated in accordance with the requirements of the Digital Services Act (DSA). Content for which a DSA procedure has been initiated is temporarily made not publicly visible.

MessageDrop does not use a personalized recommendation or ranking system. Public content is not filtered or prioritized algorithmically but is displayed solely based on the currently viewed geographic area and the time of publication.

Private chat messages are transmitted in encrypted form and are generally not readable by us in plain text.

External content (e.g., YouTube, TikTok, Spotify) is activated only at the explicit request of the user and is loaded directly from the respective third-party providers. The privacy policies and terms of use of those providers apply.

MessageDrop does not provide access to emergency services.

Only the current, complete German version of this Privacy Policy, including the supplements relating to the Digital Services Act (DSA), is legally binding.

(hereinafter “we”, “us”, or “provider”)

This Privacy Policy applies to MessageDrop (messagedrop.de), associated mobile applications, Progressive Web Apps (PWA), as well as internal admin and moderation interfaces.

###
2. Use as a visitor (without a user account)
###

###
2.1 General use
###

MessageDrop can be used without creating a user account. In particular, public content can be viewed.

###
2.2 Technical data processing
###

When used as a visitor, technically necessary data is processed, in particular the IP address, timestamps, and technical header information.

The purpose of processing is the technical delivery of the service, system security, abuse and fraud prevention, as well as error analysis and stability.

The legal basis is Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.

###
2.3 External content and third-party providers
###

MessageDrop enables the optional integration of external content from third-party providers (e.g., videos, music, animated content, or embedded media).

External content is disabled by default. Instead of the external content, an information notice is displayed informing the user that content from a third-party provider is available, along with an active decision option (e.g., a toggle) by which the respective provider can be explicitly activated.

External content is technically integrated only after a conscious and voluntary activation by the user.

Integration is carried out via embedding techniques such as iFrames or oEmbed. The content is loaded directly from the servers of the respective third-party provider. We have no influence over the type, scope, or purpose of data processing by these providers.

By activating an external content provider, the following data in particular may be transmitted to the respective provider: IP address, technical device and browser information (e.g., user agent, language settings), time of access, referrer information (if transmitted by the browser), and any other technically required request information.

At the same time, the respective provider may technically transmit data to or store data on the user’s end device, in particular cookies or comparable identifiers (e.g., local storage, session storage), pixel, tracking, or measurement technologies (where used by the provider and technically possible), as well as cache data or other technically necessary content required for delivery of the embedded content.

We have no influence over the type, scope, or purpose of this data processing by the external provider. Processing is carried out exclusively under the responsibility of the respective third-party provider. The privacy policies and terms of use of the respective provider apply.

###
3. Use with a user account
###

###
3.1 User registration
###

User registration is voluntary and осуществляется exclusively by assigning a PIN.

The following data is stored on the server side: a pseudonymous user ID, the user status (e.g., enabled or disabled), and the date of the last login.

Further user data is stored exclusively in encrypted form on the user’s end device.

The legal basis is Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR.

###
3.2 Login and authentication
###

For login, the encrypted user data set is temporarily transmitted to the backend and processed solely to verify the validity of the PIN. No permanent storage of decrypted user data or the PIN takes place.

###
3.3 Deletion and inactivity
###

Users who do not log in for a period of 90 days are removed from the backend without prior notice.

Upon removal of the user, all associated server-side data records are deleted, in particular the user ID, user status, login and activity information, as well as any other uniquely attributable server-side references.

Deletion is final and cannot be reversed.

Independently of this, the user may delete their user account at any time via the app. In this case, immediate and permanent deletion of all server-side and local data records takes place.

###
3.4 Public content and comments
###

Users may create public messages and public comments.

These contents are processed for display, moderation, abuse prevention, and enforcement of legal obligations.

Public messages and public comments are deleted after 30 days. There is no entitlement to permanent availability or archiving.

Public content may be rated (e.g., like / dislike). There is no entitlement to a specific reach, visibility, or rating outcome.

The legal basis is Art. 6(1)(b) and (f) GDPR.

###
3.5 Private communication
###

Private chat messages are transmitted using end-to-end encryption.

Read private messages are automatically deleted after 7 days. There is no entitlement to archiving or restoration.

The content of private communication is the sole responsibility of the participating users. No prior content review or ongoing monitoring takes place.

The legal basis is Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR.

###
3.6 Local data storage on the end device
###

MessageDrop follows a privacy-oriented approach in which a large portion of data is stored exclusively locally on the user’s end device.

This includes in particular local user data, settings and preferences, contacts and associations, locally cached content, cryptographic keys, and temporary working data.

Depending on the platform, storage is carried out in particular via browser IndexedDB, local app storage, and cache mechanisms of the operating system or browser.

This data is not automatically synchronized with our servers, not centrally stored, and not managed by us.

Full control over locally stored data lies with the user. The user may delete this data at any time, in particular via functions within the app, by deleting app or browser data, uninstalling the app or PWA, or resetting the browser or end device.

We have no access to locally stored data and no ability to view, back up, export, or restore such data.

If locally stored data is deleted by the user or due to technical circumstances, this may result in the loss of content, settings, or access. Restoration by us is not possible.

Responsibility for safeguarding, maintaining, and managing locally stored data lies exclusively with the user.

###
4. Digital Services Act (DSA)
###

###
4.1 DSA procedures
###

For public content and comments, a procedure under the Digital Services Act (DSA) may be initiated, in particular by notices or appeals.

In this context, we process in particular the user ID, information on the reported content, timestamps and status of the procedure, as well as decisions and reasoning.

The legal basis is Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR and Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.

###
4.2 Public case page
###

For each DSA-relevant procedure, a publicly accessible case page is provided.

This page contains exclusively anonymized or non-personal information, in particular the procedural status, the type of reported content, decisions taken, and legal reasoning pursuant to the DSA.

No personal data is published. Publication takes place solely to fulfill statutory transparency obligations.

###
4.3 Public DSA statistics
###

MessageDrop provides a publicly accessible, aggregated statistic showing the number of initiated procedures, the type of decisions, and the ratio of notices to measures taken.

The statistics contain no personal data and do not allow conclusions to be drawn about individual users.

###
4.4 Storage and disclosure
###

DSA-related moderation, decision, and procedural data is stored permanently insofar as this is required to fulfill statutory documentation, evidence, and accountability obligations.

Disclosure to competent authorities takes place exclusively within the legally required and permissible framework.

###
5. Retention period
###

Personal data is stored only for as long as required for the respective purpose or as long as statutory obligations exist.

DSA procedural data subject to statutory retention obligations is excluded from this.

###
6. Data security
###

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data against loss, misuse, or unauthorized access. However, complete protection cannot be guaranteed.

###
7. Rights of data subjects
###

You have the right to access (Art. 15 GDPR), rectification (Art. 16 GDPR), erasure (Art. 17 GDPR), restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR), data portability (Art. 20 GDPR), and objection (Art. 21 GDPR).

Consents given may be withdrawn at any time with effect for the future.

###
8. Minimum age
###

The service is not directed at persons under 16 years of age (Art. 8 GDPR).

###
9. No emergency services
###

The service does not replace emergency services and does not provide access to such services.

###
10. Changes to this Privacy Policy
###

We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy. The version valid at the time of publication shall apply.
