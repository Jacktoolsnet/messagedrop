PRIVACY POLICY
Version: 22 December 2025

IMPORTANT NOTE ON LANGUAGE
This English translation is provided for convenience only and is not legally binding. The legally binding version is exclusively the current complete German version of this Privacy Policy, including all supplements related to the Digital Services Act (DSA).

###
Short Version (not legally binding)
###

MessageDrop is a privacy-oriented web app for publishing user-generated content, private communication, and location-based organization of information.

The service can be used without a user account. Certain features require the voluntary creation of a user account.

Use of MessageDrop is permitted only for persons who are at least 16 years old.

A large portion of data is deliberately stored primarily locally on the user’s device (e.g., in browser or app storage) to ensure data minimization and a high level of data protection. Control over locally stored data generally lies with the user. Local data may be lost or deleted at any time.

Public content and comments are created by users and may be reported, reviewed, and moderated in accordance with the Digital Services Act (DSA). Content for which a DSA procedure is initiated is temporarily made not publicly visible.

MessageDrop does not use personalized recommendation or ranking systems. Public content is not algorithmically filtered or prioritized, but displayed solely based on the viewed geographic area and the time of publication.

Private chat messages are transmitted using end-to-end encryption and are generally not readable by us in plain text.

External content (e.g., YouTube, TikTok, Spotify) is activated only at the user’s explicit request and loaded directly from the respective third-party providers. Their privacy and usage policies apply.

System messages (e.g., notices regarding DSA procedures or planned maintenance) are generated exclusively by authorized administrative systems and displayed in the user frontend. System messages are always active; users cannot currently reply to them.

Profiles (name/avatar) may be used locally for better assignment. When contacting another user, a profile-sharing request may optionally be sent; the other user must actively consent. After consent, name and avatar are stored locally on the contact’s device.

Users may follow places; where technically possible and supported by the device, push notifications may be received when new public content appears at followed places. Technically required push tokens are processed solely for delivery. There is no entitlement to delivery of push notifications.

MessageDrop does not provide access to emergency services.

Only the current complete German version of this Privacy Policy is authoritative.

Glossary
###

User
Natural person who uses MessageDrop, regardless of whether a user account has been created.

User account
Technical, pseudonymous access unit that a user may voluntarily create and that is identified by a user ID.

User ID
Technical identifier of a user account. The user ID is pseudonymous and does not, by itself, allow direct identification of a person.

Visitor
User who uses MessageDrop without creating a user account.

Public content
Content created by users (e.g., public messages and comments) that is generally publicly visible unless restricted or removed.

Private communication
Communication between users that is transmitted in encrypted form (e.g., private chats).

External content / third-party providers
Content provided by third parties that is embedded only after the user’s active decision (e.g., iFrames/oEmbed). Activation involves data transfer to the respective provider.

System messages
Internal notifications generated exclusively by authorized administrative systems and displayed in the frontend (e.g., regarding DSA procedures or maintenance). System messages are not an email inbox.

DSA procedure
Procedure under the Digital Services Act (DSA), in particular notices (“Notice”) and complaints (“Appeal”) in connection with public content.

Public case page
Publicly accessible page relating to a DSA procedure on which only anonymized or non-personal information is published.

Push notifications / push token
Technical feature for delivering notifications to a device. Push tokens are technical identifiers that may be required for delivery.

Local storage
Storage of data on the user’s device (e.g., IndexedDB, app storage, cache). This data may be deleted by the user or due to technical circumstances.

###
1. Controller under the GDPR
###

The controller within the meaning of Art. 4(7) GDPR is:

JackTools.Net UG (limited liability)
Im Kirchfeld 27
38304 Wolfenbüttel
Germany

Represented by the Managing Director:
Christian Wagner, Dipl.-Inform. (FH)

Email: jacktoolsnet@gmail.com
Phone: +49 (0) 176 / 41 23 57 74

(hereinafter “we”, “us”, or “provider”)

This Privacy Policy applies to MessageDrop (messagedrop.de), associated mobile applications, Progressive Web Apps (PWA), as well as internal admin and moderation interfaces.

###
2. Use as a Visitor (without user account)
###

###
2.1 General use
###

MessageDrop can be used without creating a user account. In this case, public content may be viewed insofar as it is available.

###
2.2 Technical data processing
###

When used as a visitor, technically necessary data is processed, in particular:
- IP address,
- timestamps,
- technical header information (e.g., user agent in server logs, insofar as technically transmitted),
- request metadata for delivery and protection of the service.

The purpose of processing is technical delivery of the service, system security, abuse and fraud prevention, error analysis, and stability.

The legal basis is Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest in secure and stable operation).

###
2.3 External content and third-party providers
###

MessageDrop enables optional embedding of external content from third-party providers (e.g., videos, music, animated content, embedded media).

External content is disabled by default. Instead, a notice is displayed informing the user that content from a third-party provider is available, together with an active decision option (e.g., toggle) to explicitly activate the provider.

Only after conscious and voluntary activation by the user is external content technically embedded.

Embedding is performed via techniques such as iFrames or oEmbed. Content is loaded directly from the servers of the respective third-party provider. We have no influence on the nature, scope, or purpose of data processing by these providers.

By activating an external content provider, the following data may in particular be transmitted to the provider:
- IP address,
- technical device and browser information (e.g., user agent, language settings),
- time of access,
- referrer information (if transmitted by the browser),
- other technically necessary request information.

At the same time, the provider may technically transmit data to or store data on the user’s device, in particular:
- cookies or comparable identifiers (e.g., local storage, session storage),
- pixel, tracking, or measurement technologies (where used by the provider),
- cache data or other technically required content for delivery.

We have no influence over this data processing, which is carried out solely under the responsibility of the respective provider. The provider’s privacy and usage policies apply.

Known external providers at the time of creation include:
- YouTube (Google Ireland Limited)
- TikTok (TikTok Technology Limited / TikTok Information Technologies UK Limited)
- Pinterest (Pinterest Europe Ltd.)
- Spotify (Spotify AB)
- Tenor (Google Ireland Limited)

The list may be expanded or adjusted for technical reasons. New providers will be added in an updated version of this Privacy Policy.

The legal basis is Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR (consent). Consent may be revoked at any time with effect for the future by deactivating the provider in the settings.

###
2.4 Local profiles without user account (optional)
###

When using the service without a user account, users may optionally create local profiles for better organization and recognition. A profile may consist of a freely chosen name and an avatar (image).

These profiles are stored exclusively locally on the user’s device and are visible only to the respective user. No transmission to our servers or publication to other users takes place.

The legal basis is Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest in user-friendly presentation) or Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR where processing is required to provide a feature used by the user.

###
3. Use with a user account
###

###
3.1 Creation of a user account
###

Creation of a user account is voluntary and requires only the assignment of a PIN.

Stored server-side:
- a pseudonymous user ID,
- a user status (e.g., enabled or disabled),
- date of last login.

Further user data is generally stored exclusively in encrypted form locally on the user’s device.

The legal basis is Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR.

###
3.2 Login and authentication
###

For login, the encrypted user dataset is temporarily transmitted to the backend and processed solely to verify PIN validity. No permanent storage of decrypted user data or the PIN takes place.

Legal basis: Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR.

###
3.3 Deletion and inactivity
###

User accounts without login for 90 days are removed from the backend without prior notice.

Upon removal, all associated server-side records are deleted, including:
- user ID,
- user status,
- login and activity information,
- other uniquely attributable server-side references.

Deletion is final unless the user has a previously created backup.

Users may delete their account at any time via the app. In this case, immediate and final deletion of all server-side and local data occurs, subject to statutory retention obligations (e.g., DSA procedures).

Legal basis: Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR and Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR.

###
3.4 Public content and comments
###

Users may create public messages and comments.

Processing occurs for:
- provision and display of content,
- moderation and enforcement of usage rules,
- abuse and fraud prevention,
- compliance with legal obligations, in particular under the DSA.

Public messages and comments are deleted after 30 days.

Legal basis: Art. 6(1)(b), Art. 6(1)(f), and Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR.

###
3.5 Private communication
###

Private chat messages are transmitted end-to-end encrypted.

Read private messages are automatically deleted after 7 days.

Legal basis: Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR.

###
3.6 Local data storage on the device
###

MessageDrop follows a privacy-oriented approach in which most data is stored locally on the user’s device.

We have no access to locally stored data without the user’s cooperation.

Loss of local data may result in loss of access or content. Restoration without a user-created backup is not possible.

###
3.6.1 Backup and restore function (optional)
###

An optional backup and restore function is provided. Backups are encrypted and protected by a user-defined PIN known only to the user.

Legal basis: Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR.

###
3.7 Local profile, profile sharing, and contact profiles
###

Profiles are stored locally. Profile sharing requires explicit consent by the receiving contact.

After transfer, we cannot retrieve or delete profile data from the recipient’s device.

Legal basis: Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR and Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR (consent).

###
3.8 System messages
###

System messages are generated by authorized administrative systems and are always active.

Legal basis: Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR and Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR.

###
3.9 Following places and push notifications
###

Push tokens are processed solely for delivery purposes.

Legal basis: Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR and Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR where consent is required.

###
4. Digital Services Act (DSA)
###

###
4.1 DSA procedures
###

DSA procedures may be initiated for public content. Data processed includes:
- user ID (if available),
- reported content,
- timestamps,
- procedure status,
- decisions and reasons.

Legal basis: Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR and Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.

###
