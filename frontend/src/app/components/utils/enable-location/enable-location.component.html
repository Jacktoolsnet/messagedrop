    By enabling, you allow the app to access your device location right after launch. The location helps surface nearby
    content and is not continuously tracked. Processing prefers on-device handling; minimal data may be sent to our
    service only to deliver the feature you request (e.g., local weather). You can revoke permission anytime.
