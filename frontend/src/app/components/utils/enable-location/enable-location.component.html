    By enabling, you allow the app to access your device location when the app starts. The location is used to provide
    nearby content and is not continuously tracked. Where possible, processing happens on your device; minimal data may
    be sent to our service only to deliver the feature you request (e.g., local weather). You can revoke permission
    anytime.
