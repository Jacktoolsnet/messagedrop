            This disclaimer applies to the use of the website and app <strong>“MessageDrop”</strong> (messagedrop.de) of

        <h3 class="h">2. Availability</h3>
        <p>
            We strive to provide reliable availability. However, technical or other reasons may lead to outages or
            limitations;
            a specific level of availability is not guaranteed.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h">3. Content – our own, user-generated and third-party</h3>
        <p><strong>Our own content:</strong> We provide our own content with due care, but do not assume any warranty
            for correctness,
            completeness, or timeliness.</p>
        <p><strong>User-generated content (UGC):</strong> Users can create and share content. We employ automated
            procedures (including
            AI-assisted detection), but do <strong>not</strong> conduct comprehensive pre-moderation. Content can be
            reported; in addition,
            the “Hide” feature can hide a post <strong>globally</strong>, i.e., it will no longer be visible <strong>to
                all users</strong>.
            We review notices of unlawful content promptly and remove or block such content once we become aware of it
            (“notice-and-takedown”).</p>
        <p><strong>Third-party information:</strong> Certain features rely on external services: weather and air-quality
            data from
            <strong>Open-Meteo</strong>, translations from <strong>DeepL</strong>, and place/reverse-geocoding via
            <strong>Nominatim</strong> (OpenStreetMap). Despite careful selection, deviations, outages, quota/rate
            limits, or API changes
            may occur. We do not warrant correctness, completeness, availability, or timeliness. Use is subject to each
            provider’s terms and,
            where applicable, license requirements. <em>Note: For OpenStreetMap data, the required attribution (e.g., “©
                OpenStreetMap contributors”) is provided.</em>

        <h3 class="h">4. Embeds & external providers (YouTube, Pinterest, TikTok, Tenor, Spotify)</h3>
        <p>
            External media (e.g., YouTube videos, TikTok clips, Pinterest pins, Tenor GIFs, Spotify content) are
            embedded by users.
            Responsibility for such third-party content lies solely with the respective provider. When
            <strong>activating/displaying</strong>
            such content, data (e.g., IP address, usage data) may be transmitted to the respective provider; that
            provider’s terms and
            privacy policy apply. In the app, you can enable/disable external content <strong>per provider</strong>.

        <h3 class="h">5. Links</h3>
        <p>
            Our service may contain links to external websites. We have no control over their content; responsibility
            rests with the respective
            operator. Links were checked for potential legal violations at the time of linking. Without specific
            indications of a violation,
            permanent content monitoring is not reasonable. If we become aware of violations, we remove such links
            promptly.

            Where content is not created by us, we respect third-party rights and label such content accordingly. If you
            suspect a rights

        <h3 class="h">8. No access to emergency services</h3>
        <p>
            Our website/app does <strong>not</strong> provide access to emergency services (e.g., police, fire

    <section class="block">
        <h3 class="h">9. Local data storage (IndexedDB) & data loss</h3>
        <p>
            Our app stores certain data locally on your device/browser (e.g., in <strong>IndexedDB</strong>,
            local/session storage or the application cache)
            to enable offline/more reliable functionality. These local data are <strong>device- and
                browser-bound</strong> and are
            <strong>not</strong> automatically synchronized with other devices or a cloud (unless expressly stated
            otherwise).
        </p>
        <p>Local data can be lost or deleted <strong>at any time</strong>, including due to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>manual deletion of website/app data or browser data,</li>
            <li>use of private/incognito mode,</li>
            <li>automatic storage cleanup by the browser/OS,</li>
            <li>quota/storage limits or browser/profile changes,</li>
            <li>uninstall/reinstall (e.g., PWA) or system/browser updates.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We assume <strong>no liability</strong> for loss, damage, or unavailability of locally stored data, nor for
            resulting damages.
            Where available, please use the app’s <strong>export/backup features</strong> and keep backups outside the
            device.
        </p>

    <section class="block">
        <h3 class="h">10. Backend availability, maintenance & server-side data loss</h3>
        <p>
            Our backend is operated and monitored with reasonable care. Nevertheless, disruptions may occur, including
            planned or unplanned
            maintenance, infrastructure/provider outages, network issues, security incidents (e.g., DDoS),
            software/database updates, or force majeure.
            No specific availability or recovery time is guaranteed.
        </p>
        <p>
            We create backups at reasonable intervals. However, in an incident, <strong>data loss</strong> may occur
            (e.g., between the last backup and
            the time of the incident) or functionality may be <strong>temporarily limited</strong>. A gapless
            point-in-time recovery cannot be guaranteed.
        </p>
        <p>
            To the extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect damages, lost profits, data loss, or
            consequential damages resulting from
            backend disruptions. Claims based on intent or gross negligence and mandatory liability remain unaffected.
